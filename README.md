# PlanarityTest
Algorithm for testing whether graph is plannar.
In case it is planar, it tries to combinatorically embed it(for every vertex v, it produces the list of vertices clockwise around it).

In the program I use LR adding edges algorithm (de Fraysseix-Ossona de Mendez-Rosenstieh).

I was basing on these papers:
